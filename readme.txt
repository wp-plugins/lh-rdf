This plugin publishes your weblog as RDF in both XML and JSON. Mapping WordPress objects to the major ontologies. 

== Description ==

It has been developed for use in [LocalHero][].

[LocalHero]: http://localhero.biz/

Once activated the plugin adds a new type of feed that can be subscribed to. E.G. http://localhero.biz/?feed=lhrdf or http://localhero.biz/feed/lhrdf/ containing semantic content.

To output the feed in other triple formats just add the get variable lhrdf=format to the query string E.G. http://localhero.biz/?feed=lhrdf&lhrdf=json.

Ontologies exposed in the RDF output include:

* RDF: Resource Description Framework Ontology;
* SIOC: Semantically-Interlinked Online Communities Ontology;
* OAI-ORE Vocabulary for Resource Aggregation;
* DCTerms: Dublin Core Metadata Ontology;
* FOAF: Friend of a Friend Ontology;
* SKOS: Simple Knowledge Organization System Ontology;

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `lh-rdf` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. To enable pretty permalinks (e.g. `http://example.com/feed/lhrdf/`), go to Permalinks in the Setting menu and Save.
